#+TITLE: Tiny-sc / Branch: retiny

/Compact coding tools for SuperCollider, with Emacs Org-mode intergration/

(Tue, May 26 2015, 06:24 CEST)

This branch (=retiny=) is a re-do of all Node, Synth and Buffer management tools of the library.  The goal is to simplify object structure and usage.

This is an experimental branch.  Most documentation and code has been removed and are being rewritten from scratch.  For info on tiny-sc, see the master branch of this repository.
