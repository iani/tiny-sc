#+TITLE: Tiny-sc / Branch: retiny

/Compact coding tools for SuperCollider, with Emacs Org-mode intergration/

(Tue, May 26 2015, 06:24 CEST)

This branch (=retiny=) is a re-do of all Node, Synth and Buffer management tools of the library.  The goal is to simplify object structure and usage.

This is an experimental branch - not for general use.

Work here starts with a new class "Chuck", which is to be a simpler alternative to SynthTree.
