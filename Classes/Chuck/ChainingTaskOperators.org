QUESTION: That to do with TaskPlayers or <tox> patterns when Chuck changes to a different TaskPlayer? (use notifications to let TaskPlayers/tox patterns stop????? Too complicated?)

ANSWER: Most probably leave this to the responsibility of the user, as switching between running TaskPlayers and filters may make sense!  At most provide a method to post the list of existing TaskPlayers and filters, while marking those TaskPlayers that are currently playing.

* 1
: { func } ==> \chuckname *> <number or pattern>;

or even:

: \chuckname *> <number or pattern>;

1. Get TaskPlayer of same name as Chuck
2. Set its duration pattern
3. Connect Chuck to TaskPlayer
4. Start TaskPlayer

* 2

: { func } ==> \chuckname *> \symbol;

or even:

: \chuckname *> \symbolAir;


1. Get TaskPlayer or TaskFilter named \symbol.
2. Connect Chuck to TaskPlayer or Filter.
(3. ??? Start TaskPlayer or Filter ???)

* 3

: { func } ==> \chuckname *>.xopattern <number or pattern>;

1. Get TaskPlayer of same name as Chuck
2. Set its duration pattern
3. Get Tox named <chuckname> (enclose name of chuck in <>!)
4. Set Tox'es filter pattern to xopattern.
5. Connect Tox to TaskPlayer
6. Connect Chuck to Tox
7. Start TaskPlayer

* 4

: { func } ==> \chuckname *>.xopattern \symbol;

1. Get TaskPlayer or filter named by \symbol.
2. If it is a TaskPlayer, then create Tox using <symbol> rule and connect it to the TaskPlayer.
3. Set Tox'es filter pattern to xopattern.
4. Connect Tox to TaskPlayer
5. Connect Chuck to Tox
6. Start TaskPlayer

* 5

How to create other types of filters and connect them to TaskPlayers / Chucks?

: ClassName (parameters) *> \taskplayerorfilter

: \chuckname *>.filtername ClassName (parameters) *> \taskplayerorfilter

: { func } ==> \chuckname *>.filtername ClassName (parameters) *> \taskplayerorfilter


Generally provide a name in creation of Task Filters like this:?

: ClassName(filtername, parameters ...) ?????
