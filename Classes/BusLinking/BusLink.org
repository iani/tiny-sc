Negotiating the creation of BusLinks between two Chucks:

Given a Reader and a Writer:

* Connect a Reader to a Writer

Draft only.
Details vary  - see implementation.
Groups are nested to preserve order of children groups.

CYCLE CHECK STILL NEEDED: moving a group inside a group that it previously contains results in all groups being killed.

** Create new LinkBus

1. Create new LinkBus
2. Move/add writer to head of LinkBus group
3. Move/add reader to tail of LinkBus group

** Reorder LinkBusses

Following draft is for one case only.  It has to be decided who will move to the other's LinkBus, because moving means that either existing readers or existing writers are disconnected.  See below [[*Specify%20who%20will%20move:%20The%20Reader%20or%20the%20Writer?][Specify who will move: The Reader or the Writer?]]

1. Check if reordering would result in cycles. If not:
   1. Move group of writer's linkbus before reader's linkbus
   2. Move all groups of writer's writers successively before each other

* Specify who will move: The Reader or the Writer?
