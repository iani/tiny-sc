* Main operations and operator
Main operations are:

1. Set duration pettern (and optionally also beat pattern) of a Beat instance
2. Set beat pattern of a Beat instance
3. Set beat pattern of a subpattern of a Beat instance

Draft for operators:


set duration pattern of a Beat instance, and start playing:

: anObject || \symbol;

set duration pattern + beat pattern of a Beat instance, and start playing:

: anObject ||.beatpattern \symbol;

Note: beatpattern can be a symbol, x denoting active beats, anything else non-active beats.

Set beat pattern of main beat of Beat \beat:
: "xoxoxxx" || \beat
	// or:
: 'xoxoxxx' || \beat

Set beat pattern of subbeat pattern \bass of Beat \beat:
: "xxxoo" ||.bass \beat
	// or:
: 'xxxoo' ||.bass \beat

* Possible extension: Subpatterns of different tempi

Set some subpatterns to operate at a tempo relative to the main tempo of the pattern?

They should start relative to the first beat of the main pattern ...

Nested subpatterns possible?
