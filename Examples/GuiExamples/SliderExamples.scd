Typing 'space' on a slider toggles the synthtree controlled by that slider on-off. 

Example: 

- Type 'space' on amp slider of window1:gui to switch both sound1 and sound2 on and off.
- Type 'space' on sinamp slider of window2Lgui to switch only sound2 on and off.

Note: Sliders whose controls are shared will be updated when any one of their
controlled parameters is set.
